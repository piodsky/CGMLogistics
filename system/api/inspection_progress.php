/* Progress billing for Inspection & Acceptance — a SECOND flow, alongside the
 * single-inspection one in api/inspection.php, which this file does not touch.
 *
 * A normal purchase order is delivered once, inspected once, and paid once.
 * A progress-billing purchase order is delivered and paid in tranches, and the
 * office needs to know, per item, how much of the ordered quantity each
 * tranche covered and how much is still outstanding. That is the whole reason
 * this exists: tbl_inspection holds exactly one live row per PO, so it cannot
 * express "Progress Billing - 1 took 40 of the 200 covers".
 *
 * WHICH POs. Detected from the purchase order's own Payment Term containing
 * "Progress Billing" — the value the office already sets in Master Data — so
 * nothing has to be flagged by hand. isProgressBillingTerm() is the single
 * definition of that test and both this file and the worklist use it.
 *
 * THE LEGACY. vb/Inspection and Acceptance/Inspect.vb has
 * save_click_progress_billing(), and the two tables it writes to are on the
 * live database. It has never worked once: the header insert names four
 * columns the table did not have, it throws, and the routine's `Catch ex As
 * Exception` is empty — the operator was shown "Successfully saved!" either
 * way. See database/inspection_progress_billing.sql. Departures from it, each
 * marked where it happens:
 *   1. validation runs before anything is written;
 *   2. the save is one transaction;
 *   3. failures surface;
 *   4. items are paired to their header by (PO_Number, Billing_No), not by the
 *      Progress_Billing label alone — the legacy join omits PO_Number entirely,
 *      so "Progress Billing - 1" of one PO matches every other PO's first
 *      billing.

 *     0  live
 *     1  superseded by a later save
 *     2  retracted by an undo
 * Two values rather than one so a retracted version can never be handed back
 * by a later undo. Collapse them and "undo, revise, undo" walks back into the
 * version the FIRST undo threw away instead of the one the revision replaced,
 * because by I_ID alone the two are indistinguishable.

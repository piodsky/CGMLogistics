//   2. the whole save is one transaction (the VB ran six unwrapped statements);
//   3. failures surface (the VB caught every exception into an empty block and
//      still reported "Successfully saved!").

// version of an inspection is still on file, retired rather than overwritten
// (see the save block above). Undo therefore has nothing to reconstruct — it
// puts the previous version back, or, when the save being undone was the first
// one, takes the inspection off the purchase order and returns it to the
// worklist as awaiting inspection.
//
// After this, isDeleted carries THREE values on these two tables:
//     0  live
//     1  superseded by a later save
//     2  retracted by an undo
// Two values rather than one specifically so a retracted version can never be
// handed back by a later undo. Collapse them and the sequence "undo, revise,
// undo" walks back into the version the FIRST undo threw away instead of the
// one the revision replaced, because by I_ID alone the two are
// indistinguishable. Nothing in this app or the legacy VB reads anything but
// isDeleted = 0 on these tables — the only writes are in this file — so the
// extra value is invisible everywhere else, which is why it needs no schema
// change and no migration.
//
// Versions are paired to their line items by (PO_Number, Date_Inspected): one
// timestamp is computed per save and stamped on the header and every item row
// alike. Verified against all 16,738 inspection headers on file — no purchase
// order has two versions sharing a timestamp, and I_ID order agrees with
// timestamp order in every single case, including the rows the legacy VB wrote.
//
// Open to anyone with module access, deliberately, and not narrowed to the
// admin tier the way deleting a purchase order is: the same person can already
// press Revise and overwrite every field on the record, which is strictly more
// destructive than restoring a version that already exists. Gating undo behind
// an administrator while leaving Revise open would only mean mistakes get fixed
// by retyping. Nothing is hard-deleted, and every undo is audited and notified.

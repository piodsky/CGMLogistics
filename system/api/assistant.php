// be wrong about the numbers, which is the right way round for a system that
// COA audits.
//
// TO PUT A REAL MODEL BEHIND IT LATER: everything routes through
// assistantAnswer(), which takes the user's text and returns a reply array.
// Swap that one function for an HTTP call and the avatar, the animation
// states, the chat UI and the suggestion chips all keep working unchanged.
// Keep the data lookups below as the model's tools rather than throwing them
// away — they are what makes the answers true.

   Tracking a document.

   This is the question the office actually asks — "where is my PO", "has it
   been released yet" — and answering it is why the assistant is worth having
   at all. Three document families, one trail each:

       Purchase Order        created → approved → released to supplier
                             → COA received → inspected
       Competitive Bidding   bid opened → awarded → award received
                             → performance bond → contract signed
                             → notice to proceed
       Inspection            recorded → invoice on file → accepted by

   Every stage is a date column that already exists and that the Additional
   Details panel on each screen already maintains. Nothing is inferred: a stage
   is done when its date is filled in, and pending when it is not. There is no
   status field anywhere in this schema, and inventing one here would put a
   word on screen that the screen it came from would disagree with.
